Hello folks! Welcome to the IoT Tic-Tac-Toe game ‚Äì where the digital meets the traditional! This project runs on ATmega16 or any AVR-based microcontroller, enhanced by the power of ESP8266. Connect to MQTT, challenge a friend, and let the game begin!

## Overview

The IoT Tic-Tac-Toe game allows you to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe with a digital twist. Connect your AVR microcontroller to an ESP8266, which in turn communicates over MQTT to a PC running a Python script. Alternatively, you can have two AVR-based systems, creating a seamless two-player experience.

## Main Components Required

1. **Nokia5110 LCD Screen**
   

2. **AVR Microcontroller (e.g., ATmega16)**
   

3. **ESP8266**
   

## How it Works

1. AVR microcontroller processes the game logic.
2. ESP8266 handles the communication via MQTT.
3. Connects to a PC running a Python script for solo gameplay.
4. Or connect two AVR systems for a thrilling two-player experience.

## Contribution

Although some features are pending, you're invited to contribute and make this project even more awesome! Check out the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting Started

To set up the IoT Tic-Tac-Toe game, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Connect the Nokia5110 LCD, AVR microcontroller, and ESP8266.
3. Upload the game code to your microcontroller.
4. Run the Python script on your PC (for solo gameplay) or set up another AVR system.
